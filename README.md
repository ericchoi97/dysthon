# dysthon
 A Python syntax library for coders with dyslexia.

 You can then import the library into your Python code using the following syntax:

 from dysthon_lib import *

 After importing, you will have access to the translated Dysthon commands for each corresponding Python command. For example, you can use during instead of while, attach instead of append, words instead of dictionary, and so on.
